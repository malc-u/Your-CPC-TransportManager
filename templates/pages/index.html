        <p class="mb-2">We offer external transport manager services.
            We are specialising in working with small to medium size Operators.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
            As external transport manager our role is to ensure that Licence Operator 
            we are working with is fully compliant 100% of the time.
            This task is quite complex and requires that both parties are in at least 
            weekly contact and that trasnport manager can visit site when required but 
            minimum once a month.
